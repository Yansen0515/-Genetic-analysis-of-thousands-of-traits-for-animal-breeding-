# Title: Exploring a Bayesian sparse factor model-based strategy for the genetic analysis of thousands of MIR-spectra traits for animal breeding
## Here are included Supplemental File 1  and Supplemental File 2.

### Supplemental File 1 included 1 Table
**Table S1**. number of records of milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectra, fat percentage (Fat), methane (CH4), and somatic cell score (SCS) within the first parity (number of total animals is 3,302)  

### Supplemental File 2 included 3 Figures.
**Figure S1**. Example trace plot of the first 10 principal components on the saved MCMC samples for the G matrix of analysis in the **Fat and milk MIR spectra** dataset. The chain includes 100,000 iterations, and the first 10,000 are burn-in. 

**Figure S2**. Example trace plot of the first 10 principal components on the saved MCMC samples for the G matrix of analysis in the **CH4 and milk MIR spectra** dataset. The chain includes 100,000 iterations, and the first 10,000 are burn-in. 

**Figure S3**. Example trace plot of the first 10 principal components on the saved MCMC samples for the G matrix of analysis in the **SCS and milk MIR spectra** dataset. The chain includes 100,000 iterations, and the first 10,000 are burn-in.
