# Title: Exploring a Bayesian sparse factor model-based strategy for the genetic analysis of thousands of MIR-spectra traits for animal breeding
## Supplemental File 1 inculed Table S1 and Figure S1

### Table S1. number of records of milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectra, fat percentage (Fat), methane (CH4), and somatic cell score (SCS) within the first parity (number of total animals is 3,302)

### Figure S1. Example trace plot of the 800 saved MCMC samples for 4 estimated parameters. A: Trace plot of 10 lambda factors loading. B: Trace plot of 10 variances or covariances in additive genetic matrix (G matrix). C: Trace plot of 10 variances or covariances in residual matrix (R matrix). D: Trace plot of heritability of 10 milk mid-infrared wavepoints (WP).
